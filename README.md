# FeatureImportance
This project aims to explore some commonly used methods for feature importance measusrement, in both classical machine learning and neural network approaches. 

The term feature 'importance', or 'attribution', or 'sensitivity', could be vague in machine learning. It is either not mathmetically well-defined, or narrowed to a very specific approach hence not comparable in a larger scope. Generally speaking, there are three categories of importance measurement:
* [Univariate/Marignal Importance](#Univariate-Marignal-Importance);
* Predictive Importance;
* Causal Importance; 

## Univariate/Marignal Importance


However, we can list some good properties that a good importance measurement
